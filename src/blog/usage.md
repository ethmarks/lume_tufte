This post will walk you through how to install this theme, manage it using the
built-in CMS, and configure its plugins.

## Installation

Installing Tufte is as simple as using the Lume init command with the `theme`
option set to `tufte`.

```sh
deno run -A https://lume.land/init.ts --theme=tufte
```

The command will create a new Lume site in the current directory, add the Tufte
theme, and create a few files to get you started.

## Lume CMS

Tufte fully supports [Lume CMS](https://lume.land/cms/), which allows for easy
no-code content management.

To use it, start Lume's local live server using the command below and open
<http://localhost:3000/admin> in your browser.

```sh
deno task serve
```

You should see a page that looks something like this:

![Screenshot of Lume CMS with the items 'Blog Posts', 'Site settings', 'Homepage', 'Blog Index', '404 Page', and "uploads"](/uploads/cms-2026-06-13.png)

Feel free to explore the CMS. It's pretty intuitive to use, and I've added
explanatory comments to almost every setting. If you prefer a more guided
approach, read on.

### Site settings

The first thing we'll do after installing Tufte is configure the site settings.

From the CMS home page, click on "Site settings". You'll see a lot of settings,
but you should only need to change a few of them.

1. **Locale**: Set the Language and Date Locale settings to whatever makes sense
   for your site. The defaults are `en` and `en-GB` because the starter site is
   written in English and uses day-month-year date display conventions, but use
   whichever language you write in and whichever date convention you prefer.
   Make sure that you use valid
   [BCP 47](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/BCP_47_language_tag)
   values. A few thousand of the most common ones (e.g. `en-US`) are preloaded
   and will autocomplete as you type them.
2. **Site Name**: You'll want to change the site name from "Lume site" to
   something else. If your site is a personal website, maybe set it to your full
   name.
3. **Favicon**: The default favicon is a capital T[^T is for **T**ufte!] in the
   colors and font that TufteCSS uses[^Which I extracted directly from the
   [font SVG files](https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book/blob/gh-pages/et-book/et-book-roman-line-figures/et-book-roman-line-figures.svg).],
   but you'll probably want to change it. Click "Browse...", select your image
   in the file explorer, type in a filename for it (e.g. `custom_icon.png`), and
   press enter. Your image will be uploaded and set as the new favicon. It will
   automatically be optimized and downscaled by the
   [Favicon](https://lume.land/plugins/favicon/) plugin.
4. **Header**: If you dislike the site header I designed, feel free to
   completely disable it by unchecking `enabled`. If not, you'll want to
   customize the header links. By default, one of the links points to the
   [Tufte theme GitHub page](https://github.com/ethmarks/lume_tufte), which
   probably isn't relevant to your site, so you'll want to change or remove it.
   If your site doesn't use a particular page (e.g. the [About](/about) page),
   removing it from the header is a good way to disable it from the CMS. You can
   also add as many header links as you want, though be forewarned that adding
   too many will probably cause layout issues.

### Blog Posts

Now let's write the actual content of your site. Open "Blog Posts" from the CMS
home.

Initially, you'll see three blog posts, including this one. You'll obviously
want to delete them, which you can do by opening each one, clicking the button
next to "Save changes" that looks like three dots in a vertical line, and
clicking "Delete".

Now you'll want to create a post of your own. Click "Create new" from the Blog
Posts page.

1. **Filename**: Choose a filename for your page. This is where the post will be
   physically stored in your project, but more importantly it'll determine the
   final URL. I personally prefer to use [short slugs](https://qntm.org/urls)
   (e.g. `/usage`), but you can hyphenate the title or use some other format if
   you want (e.g. `/using-this-theme`). Just make sure not to use spaces or
   other URL-unsafe characters. Also, you'll need to end the filename with
   `.md`, or else Lume won't process it correctly. The final filename should be
   something like `mypost.md`.
2. **Metadata**: Set the title, author, and publication date of your post. The
   title can be whatever you want, but it is mandatory. The author and
   publication date fields are optional though recommended. If you don't provide
   them, they just won't be displayed.
3. **Content**: Now for the fun part. Or not, depending on how you feel about
   writing. You'll be writing the post content in
   [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). If you've used Markdown before,
   then you know exactly what to expect. If you haven't, it might take a bit of
   getting used to, but it's very easy to learn. Lume uses markdown-it, which is
   fully CommonMark compliant, but Tufte adds several plugins (some of which are
   custom) which add a bit of extra syntax for things like math blocks,
   sidenotes, collapsibles, and more. See the [Syntax section](#syntax) for more
   information.

You might notice that Lume CMS displays a preview of the page you're editing in
the left half of the screen. Depending on how you're running the CMS[^It _will_
work on localhost or on a VPS, but it will _not_ on Deno Deploy or similar.],
the preview may or may not reflect your changes as you make them, which is not
only very cool, but also very helpful for seeing how your text will _actually_
look on your site without having to constantly switch tabs.

### Other Pages

Lastly, let's modify the content of the other pages.

1. **Home Page**: This is the landing page of your site. You can change its
   Markdown content to make it say whatever you want. Maybe describe what your
   site is about. If you use the keyword `/BLOGLIST/` anywhere in the content,
   Tufte will replace it with the blog list component. You can customize the
   blog list using the Blog List settings.
2. **About Page**: This is a page at the `/about` URL. You can set its content
   to whatever you want. The default is an About Me page written from the
   anthropomorphized theme's perspective because I thought it was funny, but
   you'll obviously want to change it.
3. **Blog Index**: This is the page that lists the other blog posts. It has the
   same `/BLOGLIST/` keyword as the home page. You can change its content to
   describe what you write about.
4. **404 Page**: This is the page that displays if the user tries to visit a URL
   that doesn't exist. You don't need to change this unless you really want to,
   in which case go right ahead.

Remember that if you want to disable either the blog index or the about page,
you can just remove them from the header.

## Syntax

Tufte expands Lume's default Markdown syntax in a few ways. It's all completely
optional and normal CommonMark syntax still works perfectly, but the new syntax
allows you to write more expressively.

### Sidenotes

If you only learn one of Tufte's syntax features, sidenotes are the one to
learn. They're useful for citing sources, providing extra information, or
humorous effect.

They use a similar syntax to
[GFM's footnotes](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#footnotes),
but the sidenote text is inline and you don't need to specify the number. Here's
an example:

```md
This is my[^"my", in this case, referring to me.] paragraph text.
```

This is my[^"my", in this case, referring to me.] paragraph text.

Note that on wide screens, sidenotes are displayed to the right of the main
text, but on narrow screens (e.g. phones), they are hidden by default and you
have to tap the sidenote marker to make them visible.

### Margin notes

Margin notes are sidenotes' weird siblings. They are exactly like sidenotes in
every way, except they don't have numbers. I don't really like them, but Edward
Tufte does and maybe you do too.

They use the exact same syntax as sidenotes, but you add an asterisk after the
caret. For example:

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
```md
I am the very model of a modern major general.[^*No idea why I picked this as the example.]
```

I am the very model of a modern major general.[^*No idea why I picked this as
the example.]

### Subtitles

TufteCSS has a rule for the `.subtitle`
class[^<https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/blob/gh-pages/tufte.css#L103-L110>]
that make the text italic and have a large font size. Here it is:

```css
p.subtitle {
  font-style: italic;
  margin-top: 1rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  display: block;
  line-height: 1;
}
```

You can add the subtitle class to a paragraph directly in Markdown using
[markdown-it-attrs](https://github.com/arve0/markdown-it-attrs). For example:

```md
Written by A Bunch of Bees {.subtitle}
```

Written by A Bunch of Bees {.subtitle}

### Math

Tufte comes with Lume's [KaTeX plugin](https://lume.land/plugins/katex/), which
allows you to render math in TeX syntax.

The plugin hijacks the `math` code language, so all you have to do is use the
triple-backtick syntax and put TeX math inside. For example:

````md
```math
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
```
````

```math
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
```

### Figcaptions

To add `<figcaption>` tags to an image, Tufte includes
[markdown-it-smart-media](https://jsr.io/@ethmarks/markdown-it-smart-media)[^Which,
by the way,
[was made by me](https://github.com/ethmarks/markdown-it-smart-media)!]. It
expands Markdown image syntax to do all sorts of things, such as automatically
creating `<audio>` and `<video>` tags and automatically embedding YouTube
iframes. But it also adds support for the little-known
[image title syntax](https://www.markdownlang.com/basic/images.html#images-with-title)
to output to `<figcaption>` tags.

You just need to add your caption in quotes after the source. For example:

```md
![Alt text](/uploads/seattle.jpg "A photo I took of Seattle from the Space Needle")
```

![Alt text](/uploads/seattle.jpg "A photo I took of Seattle from the Space Needle")

### Fullwidth

On wide screens, the main content only occupies 55% of the screen width, which
leaves room for sidenotes and prevents eye strain from reading super-wide blocks
of text.

If you need extra space, add the `.fullwidth` class using the markdown-it-attrs
syntax. For example:

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
```md
![A photo I took of the Rock of Ages quarry in Vermont](/uploads/quarry.jpg) {.fullwidth}
```

![A photo I took of the Rock of Ages quarry in Vermont](/uploads/quarry.jpg)
{.fullwidth}

### Epigraphs

Tufte CSS has a bunch of styles for the `.epigraph`
class[^<https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/blob/gh-pages/tufte.css#L144-L166>]
that adds specific margins and italicizations. It requires a very specific
structure involving `<div>` and `<footer>` tags that can't be easily created in
Markdown without a complex custom markdown-it plugin that I don't really want to
make[^If you, dear reader, feel up to the task, feel absolutely free to open a
PR!]. So instead I just modified the CSS to work with a standard `<blockquote>`
structure and some custom classes. It's not quite the same and the margins are a
bit off, but it's close enough and I don't know who uses epigraphs anyways.

To use epigraphs, add the `.epigraph` class to a blockquote using the
markdown-it-attrs syntax, then add the `.quotecite` class to the very next bit
of text. You can also add an emdash to the quotecite if you want.

Here's an example using my favorite quote from Charles Babbage:[^A close
contender is when Babbage compared Benjamin Disraeli (who would later become the
Prime Minister) to Herostratus (the ancient Greek arsonist who burned down one
of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World) because he refused to approve more
funding for Babbage's experiments. Yes,
[really](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/57532/pg57532-images.html#:~:text=The%20Herostratus%20of%20Science%2C%20if%20he%20escape%20oblivion%2C%20will%20be%20linked%20with%20the%20destroyer%20of%20the%20Ephesian%20Temple.).]

```md
> On two occasions I have been asked by members of Parliament, 'Pray, Mr.
> Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers
> come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas
> that could provoke such a question. {.epigraph}

— Charles Babbage (inventor of the automatic calculator), 1864 {.quotecite}

### Code

Tufte highlights code blocks using [Nueglow](https://nuejs.org/docs/nueglow)[^By
the way, the Lume Nueglow plugin that Tufte uses
[was made by me](https://github.com/ethmarks/lume_nueglow)!]. Nueglow has
[its own special syntax](https://nuejs.org/docs/syntax-highlighting) for
highlighting specific sequences and lines.

To highlight a section, surround it with single bullet markers (e.g.
`•important•`). To underline a section, surround it with double bullet markers
(e.g. `••mistake••`). To highlight an entire line, begin it with a greater than
sign (`>`). To render a diff, use plus signs (`+`) and minus signs (`-`) to
start inserted and deleted lines, respectively.

Here's an example that uses all four. Because I'm using Nueglow to highlight the
example code block, I can't use the actual bullet marker character, so I'm going
to use a lozenge (`⬥`) instead. Just remember that they're supposed to be bullet
markers (`•`).

````md
```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

function greet(⬥user: User⬥): string {
> return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}

-const me: User = { id: 1, name: "Not Ethan" };
+const me: User = { id: 1, name: "Ethan" };
console.log(⬥⬥greet{me}⬥⬥);
```
````

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

function greet(•user: User•): string {
> return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}

-const me: User = { id: 1, name: "Not Ethan" };
+const me: User = { id: 1, name: "Ethan" };
console.log(••greet{me}••);
```

Note that Nueglow uses heuristics rather than grammars, which means that it
isn't always 100% accurate, but it supports every programming language out of
the box, even ones that it's never seen before or that you just made up.

### Collapsibles

Tufte includes the
[markdown-it-collapsible](https://npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-collapsible)
plugin to provide syntax for `<details>` tags.

It's very similar to the code block syntax, except you use plus signs instead of
backticks. Here's an example.

```md
+++This is the summary

This is the collapsible content. You can put anything you want in here.

+++
```

+++This is the summary

This is the collapsible content. You can put anything you want in here.

## Configuring Plugins

Configuring Tufte's included plugins is not possible from the CMS. You'll have
to modify your `_config.ts` file to pass options to the plugins.

For example, to change the theme of the code highlighter, you can add the
following lines:

```ts
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import theme from "theme/mod.ts";
+import { type Options as ThemeOptions } from "theme/mod.ts";

const site = lume();

+const themeOpt: ThemeOptions = {
+  nueglow: {
+    theme: "catppuccin",
+  },
+};

-site.use(theme());
+site.use(theme(themeOpt));

export default site;
```

For a complete list of plugin options, consult the documentation for each of the
included plugins:

- [Sitemap](https://lume.land/plugins/sitemap/)
- [Favicon](https://lume.land/plugins/favicon/)
- [Markdown](https://lume.land/plugins/markdown/)
- [KaTeX](https://lume.land/plugins/katex/)
- [Nueglow](https://github.com/ethmarks/lume_nueglow)

## Deployment

Once you're ready to publish your site, you can deploy it just like any other
Lume site. The
[official Lume deployment guide](https://lume.land/docs/advanced/deployment/) is
a fantastic resource that provides explanations for 13 different hosting
services.

Personally, I suggest using the native static hosting service of your Git
provider (e.g. GitHub Pages if you're using GitHub). If you're not using Git for
whatever reason, I'd suggest using [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
You just build your site on your computer, drag-and-drop the output `_site/`
folder onto the Netlify Drop website, and it'll upload it and host it on the web
for you.

## Conclusion

I hope this post was helpful! If you have any other questions, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/ethmarks/lume_tufte/issues/new) and I'll get
back to you.

I hope you enjoy using the Tufte theme!
